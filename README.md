****üß© Project Name: Doctor‚ÄìPatient Appointment System (JPQL & MapStruct Practice)****

**üß† Objective**

This project was designed to understand and implement advanced JPQL queries and MapStruct mappings within a real-world relational model of doctors, patients, and appointments.
It demonstrates mastery of JPQL joins, subqueries, projections, DTO mapping, and caching ‚Äî commonly used in enterprise-grade Spring Boot applications.

**‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack**

Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA

Database: MySQL

ORM / Query Language: JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)

Mapper: MapStruct

Build Tool: Maven

Language: Java 17

**üß± Database Design**

The system consists of three main tables:

DoctorMaster ‚Äî stores doctor details such as name, speciality, fee, and gender.

Patient ‚Äî maintains patient information like name, DOB, gender, height, and weight.

Appointment ‚Äî links doctors and patients, tracking booked appointments and timestamps.

Each appointment references both a doctor and a patient through foreign keys.

**üîç Key Learning Modules**
1. JPQL Queries

INNER JOIN: Fetch all appointments with their respective doctor names.

LEFT JOIN: Retrieve all patients with or without appointments.

RIGHT JOIN: Get all doctors, including those with no patients.

Multiple Joins: Fetch doctor name, patient name, and appointment date in one query.

Subqueries:

Doctors with fees above the average doctor fee.

Doctors having at least one appointment (EXISTS).

Patients booked with more than two different doctors.

Expressions & Functions: Patients older than 40 using (CURRENT_DATE - dob).

Pagination: Fetch patients in batches of 20 for performance optimization.

Query Optimization: Retrieve only required fields (IDs, names, etc.) instead of full entities.

Query Hints: Cache doctor data for repeated access.

Filtering: Fetch doctors with appointments within the next 7 days or patients with appointments in a given month.

2. Projections & DTO Mapping

Constructor Expressions:

DoctorSummaryDTO(id, name, speciality)

AppointmentDetailsDTO(doctorName, patientName, bookedOn)

Nested DTO:

AppointmentViewDTO(appointmentId, bookedOn, doctor(doctorId, doctorName), patient(patientId, patientName))

Spring Data Projection Interfaces:

For lightweight data views like patient name and DOB.

3. MapStruct Integration

Mapped DoctorMaster ‚Üí DoctorSummaryDTO using MapStruct.

Created nested mappers to map Appointment ‚Üí AppointmentViewDTO with embedded doctor and patient data.

Combined multiple entities into a custom reporting DTO to simulate real-world data reporting use cases.

**üöÄ Outcome / Learning**

This project solidified practical understanding of:

Writing and optimizing JPQL queries for complex business use cases.

Using MapStruct for clean, maintainable DTO mapping without manual boilerplate.

Designing entity relationships and DTO structures used in enterprise-grade backend systems.

Implementing pagination, caching, and projection-based optimizations for high performance.
